Major issue nowadays is lack of good communication between children and parents. So we attempted to identify depression in children. 
Childhood depression is different from the normal "blues" and everyday emotions that occur as a child develops. Just because a child seems sad doesn't necessarily mean he or she has significant depression. If the sadness becomes persistent, or interferes with normal social activities, interests, schoolwork, or family life, it may indicate that he or she has a depressive illness. Keep in mind that while depression is a serious illness, it is also a treatable one.

How Can I Tell if My Child Is Depressed?
The symptoms of depression in children vary. It is often undiagnosed and untreated because they are passed off as normal emotional and psychological changes. Early medical studies focused on "masked" depression, where a child's depressed mood was evidenced by acting out or angry behavior. While this does occur, particularly in younger children, many children display sadness or low mood similar to adults who are depressed. The primary symptoms of depression revolve around sadness, a feeling of hopelessness, and mood changes.

Signs and symptoms of depression in children include:

Irritability or anger
Continuous feelings of sadness and hopelessness
Social withdrawal
Increased sensitivity to rejection
Changes in appetite -- either increased or decreased
Changes in sleep -- sleeplessness or excessive sleep
Vocal outbursts or crying
Difficulty concentrating
Fatigue and low energy
Physical complaints (such as stomachaches, headaches) that don't respond to treatment
Reduced ability to function during events and activities at home or with friends, in school, extracurricular activities, and in other hobbies or interests
